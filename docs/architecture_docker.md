## Docker compose

A Docker Compose configuration was implemented to streamline the integration and management of all project services, including the frontend, backend, and database. This setup simplifies deployment by defining and orchestrating the required containers in a single configuration file, ensuring seamless communication between services and facilitating local development, testing, and production deployment.

## Docker images

To enhance efficiency and security, all Docker images were built using multi-stage builds. This approach minimizes the final image size by including only the necessary dependencies and binaries, reducing storage and improving performance when pushing images to the cloud (Docker repositories) or storing them locally. Additionally, environment variables were used to dynamically inject system values into the images, ensuring configuration flexibility while preventing the exposure of sensitive information, such as credentials or API keys.

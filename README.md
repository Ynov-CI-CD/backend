## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main repositories: the backend (NestJS) and the frontend (Angular). Both parts are organized into separate directories:

- `back`: Contains the backend code, including NestJS configuration, TypeScript source files, and test files.
- `front`: Contains the frontend code, including Angular configuration, TypeScript source files, and test files.

## Key Features

- Backend:
    - Built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework.
    - Uses TypeScript for type-safe development.
    - Implements a RESTful API for user management.
    - Includes unit tests, integration and end-to-end tests using Jest and supertest.

- Frontend:
    - Built with Angular, a popular TypeScript-based framework.
    - Uses Angular CLI for project setup and development.
    - Implements a user interface for managing users.
    - Includes unit tests, integration and end-to-end tests using Angular's testing framework.

## Project Evaluation

- Achieved nearly 100% code coverage through Unit Tests to validate the mechanics of specific features.
- Completed nearly 100% Integration Test coverage to ensure end-to-end functionality, including template changes and interactions.
- Automated the generation of functional documentation, a structured README, and coverage reports deployed to Codecov.
- Implemented a workflow encompassing testing, global deployment, and GitHub Pages integration.

**Bonus:**

- The UI/UX of our Angular application is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
- The code is properly implemented and optimized on both the backend and frontend, ensuring smooth functionality across the entire application.
